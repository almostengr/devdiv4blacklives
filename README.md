## Learning Resources ✊🏿 

### Small steps (Resources requiring 5 minutes or less of your time)
* Here are a series of short 1 minute videos on systemic racism in different areas of American life. Shows that systemic racism affects black people, but also other minorities. https://www.raceforward.org/videos/systemic-racism

* Choose how much time you have each day to become more informed as step one to becoming an active ally to the black community. In this document there are links to the learning resources and a schedule of what to do each day.

### Are you just getting started or wondering 'What do they mean by anti-racism?'
* Here is the Anti-Racism for Beginners guide: http://antiracismforbeginners.com/


### BLM Statistics
Here are some statistics related to systemic racism:

📣 Net worth: The median net worth of a white family is $171,000, while that of a typical black family is $17,150: https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/27/examining-the-black-white-wealth-gap/

* Factor in centuries of some being able to own land, houses and slaves, not have to deal with redlining or housing discrimination

* Factor in impediments like the massacre  of Tulsa’s Greenwood district (“black wall street”) 

📣 Black unemployment rate has been around twice that of the white unemployment rate for the last ~60 years: https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2020/02/24/480743/persistence-black-white-unemployment-gap/

📣 African-american and Asian-american resumes were about  twice more likely to get  call-backs when whitened and / or scrubbed of racial clues. https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/minorities-who-whiten-job-resumes-get-more-interviews

### Housing segregation 

(really good 6 minute explanation of housing segregation history): https://www.facebook.com/NPR/videos/701877010588148/  

Points from video:

📣 In 1934 (and over the next 30 years), Neighbourhoods were redlined based on socio-economic status and RACE. “Negro and foreign-born” neighborhoods were redlined made it harder, if not impossible to buy / re-finance homes, leading to lower property values, neglect, unreliable city services and higher crime.

📣  Some suburbs created rules / covenants forbidding selling homes to black people.

### Fair Housing Act passed in 1968. 
* Does little to fix existing problems. 
* Lives and generations already affected. 
* Not really enforced. 
* Home ownership major source of wealth in America.
* Quality of education tied to property taxes.
* Higher quality of education increases the value of homes (Remember neighborhoods were segregated and now generally still sclical). segregated.

🤔 Personal Thought: Think about it we are only two mortgages away from the Civil Rights Act and fair housing act. Which didn’t fix existing problems and aren’t always enforced.

### Health 

📣 People of color are more likely to live near industrial plants that pollute the environment and further from grocery races. This leads to higher rates of certain cancers and asthma. This also leads to problems with police. Segregation makes racial profiling of neighborhoods more likely. Leads to lower trust of police.

📣 Black babies have an infant mortality 2.3 times higher than that of non-hispanic white babies

🤔 I will encourage you to think, why these huge disparities between different races? Could America's history of slavery and segregation play a part? Do current / recent policies play a part? Do people's biases and media portrayal of races play a part?

 🛐  For Christians, how has America eagerly tried to fix the problems caused by racism and slavery in its history? Is America practicing restorative justice? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A14THPoc4-4
