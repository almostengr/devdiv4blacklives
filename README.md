# devdiv4blacklives
This repository offers the entire DevDiv community a starting point to educate themselves on the challenges created by systemic racial injustice. This is a collaborative effort, so please add these resources. Use these materials, add others that aren't included, and remember to listen to Black friends and colleagues about what it is _they_ need for support.
